Update v0.2.2
  * Added file download for TLD test. This does download a TLD list from iana.org and creates a tmp file that gets updated daily.
    - original file exists here: https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt
    - file tests for a ~/tmp/ directory in the current user, makes if needed, then places the temp file there.
  * Added several sanity checks in the exectution of the script
    - Now verifies fully qualified TLD's
    - Tests to allow flag placement at beginning or end of script
  * Added additional noting and error reporting
